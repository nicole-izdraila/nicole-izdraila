# About me
- I am currently a third-year Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary, with a minor in Mechatronics. I have had the privilege of working on several projects that include full stack and databases. I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies and domains. Right now, I'm diving deeper into embedded systems, networking, and operating systems. I'm open to collaborating on projects, especially ones that challenge me and offer learning opportunities. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to work together or simply chat about tech!
